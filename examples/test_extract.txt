When you mix science and politics, you get politics. The White House says the country has to learn to live with the virus. Italy, Germany and dozens of other countries have reopened almost entirely, and they had every reason to do so. In the United States, public health experts were virtually unanimous that replicating European success required, first, maintaining the shutdown until we achieved a steep downward slope in cases; second, getting widespread compliance with public health advice; and third, creating a work force of at least 100,000 — some experts felt 300,000 were needed — to test, trace and isolate cases. In Houston, where one of the country’s worst outbreaks rages, officials have called on the governor to issue a stay-at-home order. Many states now have so many cases that contact tracing has become impossible anyway. The virus is already too widely disseminated for these actions to quickly bend the curve downward. Depending on local circumstances, that may prove insufficient; a comprehensive April-like shutdown may be required. Half-measures will leave too many Americans not living with the virus but dying from it.
